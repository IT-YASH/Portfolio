# Merging Two Separate Portfolio Folders

Rather than merging two separate portfolio folders into one, I've opted to maintain both versions within a single repository. Each version represents a distinct approach or iteration of my portfolio design and content. While this setup offers convenience in terms of managing and organizing the codebase, it also introduces potential challenges, such as ensuring consistency and avoiding conflicts between the two versions. By carefully structuring the repository and documenting any differences or dependencies between the versions, I aim to facilitate ease of navigation and understanding for collaborators and future contributors. This approach allows for flexibility in showcasing different design choices or content variations while maintaining a centralized repository for my portfolio projects.
